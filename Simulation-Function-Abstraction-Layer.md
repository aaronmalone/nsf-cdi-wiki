### About

The simulation function abstraction layer provides a single interface for executing multiple, concurrent calculations on a pool of simulation function processes (SFPs). It handles all of the details of maintaining a network of SFPs (using LAPIS), queuing calculation requests, dispatching calculation requests to individual SFPs, and retrieving results. This allows clients of the simulation function abstraction layer's API to request calculation of simulation function results without worrying about _where_ the calculation will eventually run, _whether resources are currently available_ to run the calculation, and _how to retrieve calculation results_ using LAPIS.
