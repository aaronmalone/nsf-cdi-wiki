#Weather Model

## Brief Description
Weather model is used to forecast temperature, solar radiation and wind speed for any location in the United States. There are two weather models, Base Weather Model and Interpolated Weather Model. The Base Weather Model forecasts the weather for 61 locations in the United States with an Vector Autoregression model. The Interpolated Weather Model forecasts the weather for other locations by interpolation. 

The latitudes and longitudes for the 61 locations in the Base Weather Model are：
[  35.04	-106.62	]

## INPUTS
Enter your inputs here.  Make sure to include:

Base Weather Model
* variable name
* expected size and whether it is dynamic or static
* short description
* type (int, float, string)

Interpolated Weather Model
* variable name - baseweather, location
* 
baseweather - the forecastings of weather data generated by the Base Weather Model. It should be a cell array of 61 cells and the dimension of each cell is 168*3
location - the latitudes and longitudes for which the weather is going to be generated. It should be 2*n vector arranged as [latitude longitude], n is the number of cities. 
* type (int, float, string)
